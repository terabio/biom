    A class representing a biological experiment, which consists of a biological material isolated from a sample,

    Attributes
    ----------
    ind : str
        Experiment ID, must be unique within the project.
    sample : Sample
        The biological sample from which the library was generated.
    library : Library
        The library generated from the sample.
    runs : tuple[SeqRun, ...]
        The sequencing runs performed on the library.
    description : str
        A description of the experiment, if available.

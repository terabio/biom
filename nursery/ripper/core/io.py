    # chrom - Name of the chromosome (or contig, scaffold, etc.).
    # chromStart - The starting position of the feature in the chromosome or scaffold. The first base in a chromosome is numbered 0.
    # chromEnd - The ending position of the feature in the chromosome or scaffold. The chromEnd base is not included in the display of the feature. For example, the first 100 bases of a chromosome are defined as chromStart=0, chromEnd=100, and span the bases numbered 0-99.
    # name - Name given to a region (preferably unique). Use "." if no name is assigned.
    # score - Indicates how dark the peak will be displayed in the browser (0-1000). If all scores were "'0"' when the data were submitted to the DCC, the DCC assigned scores 1-1000 based on signal value. Ideally the average signalValue per base spread is between 100-1000.
    # strand - +/- to denote strand or orientation (whenever applicable). Use "." if no orientation is assigned.
    # signalValue - Measurement of overall (usually, average) enrichment for the region.
    # pValue - Measurement of statistical significance (-log10). Use -1 if no pValue is assigned.
    # qValue - Measurement of statistical significance using false discovery rate (-log10). Use -1 if no qValue is assigned.
    # peak - Point-source called for this peak; 0-based offset from chromStart. Use -1 if no point-source called.
